Input
The program takes input from the user through a dropdown menu. The user can select a movie genre like "All Genres," "Science Fiction," "Drama," or "Action." This selection helps the program know what movies to show.

Process
When the user selects a genre, the program filters the list of movies to show only those that match the chosen category. The MovieList component does this by checking each movieâ€™s genre and updating the list.

Output
The filtered list of movies is shown on the screen, displaying the movie title, genre, and release year. If the user clicks on a movie, a message appears showing the name of the movie.
