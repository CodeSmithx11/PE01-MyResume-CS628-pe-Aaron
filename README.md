# MyResume

Input
The program takes static input, which includes information about the user's name, contact details, education, skills, work experience, and projects. This information is hardcoded in the Resume.js file as structured HTML elements. No user interaction or dynamic data entry is required.

Process
The program uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create and display the resume. The information is organized into components, with Resume.js handling the layout and structure of the resume. The styling is managed separately in the Resume.css file, which defines the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. Reactâ€™s component-based structure makes it easy to maintain and update the resume.

Output
The program generates a visually appealing resume web page that displays all the input data in an organized and styled format. The output is viewable in a web browser and matches the specified design requirements, such as background color, font styles, and layout.
